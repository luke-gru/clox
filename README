======

Lox (clox) is an object-oriented scripting language developed alongside the reading of
craftinginterpreters (craftinginterpreters.com) by Bob Nystrom.

I've followed along, but added my own features as well.

Added features:
* Splatted (rest) parameters and arguments
* Default arguments
* Keyword arguments
* Mutable strings
* Modules similar to Ruby's
* Blocks similar to Ruby's
* Integrated debugger
* Integrated REPL
* Multi-process support using fork() syscall
* Basic multi-threading with libpthread and a global VM lock
* try/catch blocks
* Iterators and foreach() statement
* String interpolation
* Map (hash/dict) literals
* Object finalizers

Some internal differences:
* creation of AST before compilation phase (separate parser/compiler)
* bytecode optimization passes (including constant folding)
* Easy way to create objects in C functions without having to hide
them from GC, even if they're not pushed to operand stack (aka rooted).
* Faster garbage collector with managed heaps (but also wastes more memory
right now)

Future features:
* Support for regex
* Add some standard library and networking support
* Support non-ascii strings
* Add constants (no redefinitions, will given compiler or runtime error)
* Improve managed heaps memory waste
* Add generational GC

OS/compiler support:
* Only tested on linux (Ubuntu 16.04), uses fork() and libpthread, as well as C99 features.
* Not C++ compliant

Examples:
See examples folder. These are also tests run by the ./bin/test_examples
binary (see Makefile for more details).

Thanks to Bob Nystrom for the book and github repo!
