TODO
====

NOTE: This is just a brainstorm of things to do, in no special order. Not
all listed features/improvements are going to get done.

Features
--------

* Add Array#deleteAt
* Add Map#replace(other)
* Add String#replace(other)
* Make it so that global variables aren't accessible everywhere, or that
the syntax is different for them, like in ruby.
* Dumping/loading values to/from disk
* Saving/loading bytecode to disk
* Add tracing/coverage information
* add multiple var declaration, setters for array returns [GIT BRANCH]
* Add socket class in io.c, make it work with multi-threading
* Allow getters to be called like methods (when given 0 args) [PARTIAL]
  works for instances, not classes or modules (ex: Array.name())
* Allow '?' or '!' at end of method name?
* Disallow property get/set outside of class like Ruby? Also, make property
get/set a different sigil maybe, like @prop.
* Add method privacy (private/public)
* Add defineMethod() function
* Allow dynamically loading lox extensions, which can be '.so' files.
* Add Dir static class method 'glob'
* Add guilds, with per-guild VM lock and restricted guild to guild sharing

Improvements
------------
* Get threads running concurrently even with at least 1 mutex (right now, any
mutex held blocks release of GVL for a thread)
* Allow more constants in a chunk (more than 256 bytes)
* Allow bigger jumps (more than 1 byte offsets) [GIT BRANCH]
* Allow debugger (first, native functions maybe?) to list local variables, global variables, etc.
* Throw SyntaxError from invalid compile/parse if given flag
* Make variable lookup work as lookup in Environment tables, not statically
compiled lookup
* Add more to File class
* Allow giving keyword args to native functions
* Use alloca where possible to reduce mallocs/frees for data structures like
ErrTagInfo and BlockStackEntry, used during setjmp/longjmp
* Change string representation to UTF8
* Make autoloading thread-safe

Bugs
----
* super bug for getters/setters (examples/super_setter.lox)
* Nodes created during parsing are never freed. This results in memory leak
when evaling.
* loadScript/requireScript should use pwd of lox process during startup for
file lookup, not pwd when calling loadScript/requireScript
* Debugger bugs, not evaluating variables in context of function
* +=, -=, etc. doesn't work for non-variables/propsetters, like arg[0] +=1, or other lvalues
* GC stress=full (full GC after every allocation) fails for certain scripts in examples/ with 'thread' or
'mutex' in their name. See test/test_stress_gc.rb for details.

Optimizations
-------------

* more bytecode optimization passes (ex: skip OP_NIL,OP_RETURN after an OP_RETURN)
* Add specialization bytecodes
* Add tailcall optimization
* Add common subexpression elimination to optimizations in compiler
* simple (tracing?) JIT
* different GC strategies, maybe support copying GC (but then need to change
Value representation, no more tagging, need to use struct).
* optimize method lookup with a polymorphic inline cache and benchmark the lookup results
* Improve cref pushing/popping, a lot of time same cref is pushed to stack back-to-back
