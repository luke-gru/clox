* More language features to be close to my version of jlox []
* Simple M&S GC [DONE]
* Saving/loading bytecode to disk []
* Debugger support []
* bytecode optimization pass []
* simple JIT, maybe? []

* AND/OR short-circuit eval [DONE]
* catch across function boundaries [DONE]
* throw/catch from C native functions [DONE], just have to pop proper #
arguments off the stack when an error is caught in native C func.
* Get closures working []
* Get arrays working [PARTLY DONE]
* Get maps working [PARTLY DONE]
* interactive mode (repl) [DONE]
* add builtin classes [IN PROGRESS]
* Fix VM callable to always add stack frame, even for C functions. This will
help with throwing from C functions as well. []


BUGS:
Calling native functions keeps the function object on the stack for some
reason
